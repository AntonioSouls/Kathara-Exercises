# KATHARA-EXERCISES

***Kathara-Exercises*** it is a repository in which all my personal solutions to the labs proposed during the `Internet and Data Centers` course are saved.
This repo contains labs and traces of old exams carried out during the course, divided according to the topics of the exemptions.
